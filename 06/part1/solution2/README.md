So, I was pretty proud of my first solution, but I was surprised at how slow it ranâ€”it took well over 30 seconds to compute the answer. I started thinking about it, and I thought, "Of course it takes a long timeâ€”when you get past 4,000 cycles, you have over 8,000,000 state comparisons to make (`(n*(n-1))/2`)! And then I went on to other tasks like: making a sandwich, eating a sandwich, thinking about whether or not a sandwich counts as a meal, etc. At some point it hit meâ€”why am I doing all those comparisons! ðŸ˜® I was comparing every state to every state **each cycle**! All I needed to do was to compare the last state to the previous states. After making the very slight tweak, my new code ran 1000x faster (in my first test, solution2 took 32.09 **milli**seconds and solution1 took 35.65 seconds). Being curious, I even modified each solution so that they'd report how many individual bank comparisons were performed. Solution1 does 12,719,565,909 bank comparisons to find the answer. Solution2 only does 9,352,077. That's 12,710,213,832 unnecessary operations. Whoops! ðŸ˜…
